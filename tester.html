<p><p><b>Learning Armor Masteries.</b>Whenever a player would choose a weapon to benefit from the Weapon Mastery feature, they can instead choose to learn an armor mastery property.</p>
<p><strong>Using Armor Masteries.</strong> When a creature takes any of the <em>Trigger Actions</em> associated with an armor property that they know <strong><em>as an Action</em></strong>, they can gain the benefits of that armor property until the start of their next turn (no action required). They must be wearing an armor set of the associated armor category to gain these benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Armor or Weapon Masteries.</strong> While a creature is benefiting from an armor mastery property, it cannot benefit from weapon masteries.</p>
<p><strong>No Double Masteries.</strong> A creature can only benefit from one armor mastery property at any given time.</p>
<h4 id="armor-mastery-example">Armor Mastery Example</h3>
<p>At level 1, Jeremy is choosing weapon masteries for his fighter character, Gertrude. Jeremy decides that he will replace two of her Weapon Masteries with Armor Masteries. He chooses the <em>Withstand</em> armor mastery, the <em>Bash</em> armor mastery, and the <em>Warhammer</em> weapon mastery. In total, Gertrude has the following masteries: Warhammer, Withstand, and Bash.</p>
<p>When the first fight begins, Gertrude is wearing her chainmail and uses her action to attack with her warhammer. At this moment, she can choose to benefit from her <em>Withstand</em> armor property, benefit from her <em>Bash</em> armor property, or continue benefiting from the <em>Slow</em> property of her warhammer. Activating an armor property will mean that she cannot benefit from <em>Slow</em> until the start of her next turn.</p>
<p>Since she&#39;s found herself surrounded, Gertrude chooses to benefit from the <em>Withstand</em> property this time, hoping to avoid losing too much HP from the oncoming attacks.</p>
